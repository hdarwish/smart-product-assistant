Smart Product Assistant: AI-Enhanced E-Commerce Feature

Overview

You will be building a "Smart Product Assistant" - an AI-enhanced e-commerce feature that enables users to search for products using natural language and receive intelligent recommendations.


Project Requirements
Core Features

Natural Language Product Search

Implement a search interface that accepts conversational queries

Example queries: "I need a lightweight laptop for college," "What's a good gift for a coffee enthusiast?"

Integrate with an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to process these queries

Product Catalog

Create a database with 15-20 sample products across various categories

Each product should include:

Name

Description

Price

Category

Image URL (you may use placeholder images)

Additional attributes (color, size, etc.)

AI-Enhanced Recommendations

Process user queries through an LLM to match with relevant products

Display recommended products with explanations of why they match the query

Implement a simple ranking or relevance scoring system

Technical Requirements

Frontend:

Implement using a modern JavaScript framework (React preferred, but Vue/Angular acceptable)

Create a responsive, mobile-friendly UI with:

Search bar for natural language queries

Product listing with cards/grid layout

Individual product view

Include basic styling (CSS/SCSS, styled-components, or UI framework)

Backend:

Build a RESTful API or GraphQL endpoint

Implement database integration (SQL or NoSQL)

Create endpoints for:

Product search/retrieval

LLM integration for query processing

(Optional) User session management

LLM Integration:

Connect to a large language model API of your choice
